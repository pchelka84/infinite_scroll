# INFINITE SCROLL

The goal of the project is to implement infinite scroll functionally - something that happens on social media. As a user scrolls down the page, another network request is made. It happens before the bottom of the page is reached, so user don't see it which creates an illusion of infinite scroll.

The app makes an asyncronious fetch request to get photos from Unsplash.com/API.  

## HOW TO RUN

1. Clone or download a local copy of the app.
2. Get you API Key from [unsplash.com/API](https://unsplash.com/developers) and replace `const apiKey = 'Your_API_key' with your key.
3. Run the project with the Live Server.
